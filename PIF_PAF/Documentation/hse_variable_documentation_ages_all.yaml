### HSE VARIABLE DOCUMENTATION - ALL AGES ###

# This document is designed to describe the structure of the variables in the HSE datasets from 1995-2019
# It is an alternate version of hse_variable_documentation.yaml that groups all ages together
# This is so the same variables  can be extracted methodically from the data with minimal intervention
# Each entry will be a variable of the survey subset by year groups with the following data:
#   - varname: variable name in the dataset
#   - dict: dictionary descibing what levels go to what output
