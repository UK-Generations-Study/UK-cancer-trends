README - PIF_PAF

This folder is designed to hold all code and output of the PAF/PAF paper under development.
It will NOT contain all data as a portion of the data extracted will be from UKDS which requires only users who have signed the agreement to access the data.
The specific sources of the external data will still be cited here: Data/README_Internal_Data.txt for anyone looking to recreate results.
