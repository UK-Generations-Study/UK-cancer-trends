# Position Paper

## Overview
Goal is to combine public sources of information to get an effective view of the trends of cancer incidence/mortality and risk factors in the UK. These will then be plotted in graph for fast understanding.

### [Cancer Mortality](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Cancer%20Mortality%20UK.html)
Tabulation of top cancers by mortality in the UK. Data is sourced from [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/mortality/common-cancers-compared#heading-Zero). This list was used to generate the cancers we would focus on in the position paper. 
### [Position Paper Graphs](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Position%20Paper.html)
Initial graphs generated for the position paper. Data for the graphs is in the Data folder, and the sources for the data are documented in the Data_Sources.xlsx file as well as the README.txt file which goes into more detail.
### [Cancer Projections](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Projection%20Plotting.html)
Trends and projections for the cancers selected.
