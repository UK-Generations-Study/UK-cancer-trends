# Trends Paper

## Overview
Goal is to combine public sources of information to get an effective view of the trends of cancer incidence/mortality and risk factors in the UK. These will then be plotted in graphs.

## Contents
### [Cancer Mortality](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Cancer%20Mortality%20UK.html)
Tabulation of top cancers by mortality in the UK. Data is sourced from [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/mortality/common-cancers-compared#heading-Zero). This list was used to generate the cancers we would focus on in the position paper. 
### [Position Paper Graphs](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Position%20Paper.html)
Initial graphs generated for the position paper. Data for the graphs is in the Data folder, and the sources for the data are documented in the Data_Sources.xlsx file as well as the README.txt file which goes into more detail.
### [Cancer Projections Globocan](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Projection%20Plotting%20Globocan.html)
Trends and projections for the cancers selected using data from Globocan.
### [Cancer Projections CRUK](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Projection%20Plotting%20CRUK.html)
Trends and projections for the cancers selected using CRUK data and comparing to CRUK projections.
### [Final Position Paper Figures](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/Final%20Position%20Paper%20Figures.html)
A more formal list of the figures being considered for the position paper.
### [PAFs](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Code/PAF_paper.html)
Population Attributable Fraction project
### [Sources](https://uk-generations-study.github.io/UK-cancer-trends/Sources)
An initial list of sources to consider when writing the position paper.
