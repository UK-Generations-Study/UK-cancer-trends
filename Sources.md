## Initial Sources

### Introduction
This is a brief and informal collection of sources that describe and explain to some extent the trends in certain risk factors for cancers in the UK. Despite the formal appearance of this paper, it is just being used as an easy way of collecting papers with citations with brief explanations of them.

### BMI
This paper by Broadbent et al. [(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10894838/pdf/archdischild-2023-325844.pdf) looks specifically at childhood obesity rates in England. It uses two sources, HSE (same source as we used) and the Child Measurement Program which follows specific school years. Breaks down the changes in rates by social factors such as deprivation index and family structure etc.  
  
This paper by Keaver et al. [(2)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855666/) looks at projecting obesity trends in the UK into the future. It uses the HSE, SHS and NSW data that we have also used in graphs. It breaks down the projections by social factors in a similar way to the paper above.

This paper by Ochao-Moreno et al. [(3)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0296013) looks at the costs of the rise in obesity during the COVID pandemic. It breaks down the trends by factors such as deprivation, and looks at the costs from economic and healthcare perspectives.

### Alcohol
A paper by Holmes et al. [(4)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/add.14754) looks at trends in alcohol consumption in Great Britain through cohorts, ages and years. They track the changes in alcohol consumption in the quartiles of alcohol consumption, i.e. are heavy drinkers drinking more than they used to? Sadly, the paper only uses data up to 2011 so it is likely not representative of current trends. The data they use is from the General Lifestyle Survey, which is a cross-sectional household survey, differing from the HSE data we collected for alcohol usage.  
  
This paper by Monk et al. [(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10096461/pdf/pone.0283233.pdf), explores alcohol usage during the pandemic, and tries to make links between those trends and motivations for drinking influenced by the pandemic such as job status. They sample from the YouGov research panel both before and during the pandemic and draw conclusions from the data collected on alcohol usage and motivations. It would be useful to see a paper exploring usage post pandemic also, to see if any trends have reverted, but this may be challenging due to the recency of the pandemic.  
  
A notable policy change was the introduction of the minimum unit pricing in Scotland. This paper by Holmes [(6)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/add.16185) looks at a variety of sources to see if the policy has had an effect. Sadly the data we have currently collected does not extend to the necessary dates to be used for this study, but it is still notable the effects this paper believes the policy has had. Namely, the consumption of alcohol overall has gone down, but the effect of the policy on overdrinking is unknown.

### Smoking
A paper by Breton et al. [(7)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/add.15696) followed a similar technique to that of Holmes et al. by following cohorts, ages and years to study the changes in smoking over time in the UK. They use 3 sources of data, including the HSE data used for the position paper's initial graphs.  
  
Another paper that may link well into the following is a study written by Jackson et al. [(8)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496468/pdf/ntab119.pdf). In this study, they observe the links between smoking and e-cigarette usage, as well as looking at the trends of e-cigarette usage. They particularly focus on the usage of e-cigarettes in situations where smoking is not allowed. This could be an interesting point to mention as it pertains to consequences of decreasing smoking levels.

### Physical Activity
Physical activity papers reporting on trends are hard to find, as this was a risk factor that was majorly affected by COVID-19. This means that the bulk of the literature surrounding the topic is focused on the pandemic era.  
  
A paper that might still be a useful reference is a paper by McCarthy et al. [(9)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33347421/). In this paper they discuss physical activity trends in the UK in the time surrounding the first of the COVID-19 lockdowns. They use information generated from a smartphone app in a 6-month window around the lockdown. This is a very small window but could be used to discuss how activity trends may have suffered long term from the lockdown if no other resources were available.  
  
There is also a report from Sport England [(10)](https://sportengland-production-files.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2023-04/Active%20Lives%20Adult%20Survey%20November%202021-22%20Report.pdf?VersionId=ln4PN2X02DZ1LF18btgaj5KFHx0Mio9o) into activity levels in adults that uses data that we have collected and could use in place of the currently used HSE data which is more sparse. This report delves into the data collected and looks at a few themes including post-COVID activity rates increasing again, and disparity in activity levels across social factors in the UK.  

### Birth Rates
A paper by Ermisch [(11)](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol45/29/45-29.pdf) examines trends in English fertility (England and Wales) by looking at data from the UK Longitudinal Health Study. Specifically, it examines fertility rates and attempts to create models to predict total fertility rates across years. It discussed some demographic related trends a little, but the main take-away is the continuation of lowering fertility rates in the UK. For the paper, we have chosen currently to look at age at first birth and parity % but these are both factors that help describe fertility rates.  
  
This paper by Berrington et al. [(12)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/psp.2546) also seeks to project total fertility rates into the future, with a focus on the effect of the pandemic on fertility in the UK. They use data from the ONS, which is the same data as we have collected on fertility. An idea suggested in the paper is that the decrease in fertility rates is driven by younger people, this seems to be reflected in the age at first birth diagram which is steadily increasing.  

### HRT
A paper by Alsugeir et al. [(13)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9904798/pdf/bjgpopen-6-0126.pdf) analyses the changes in HRT prescriptions in the UK. They use a different dataset to ours, looking at primary care data and inferring HRT prescriptions from that. They observe the same trends that we can see in the data we have utilised, namely that HRT usage is on the rise, with a dip in 2020, most likely due to the pandemic. There are many reasons they suggest for this increase, such as the changing on NICE guidelines and raised awareness of menopause.  

### Diabetes
This paper by Goodall et al. [(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319179/pdf/41598_2021_Article_94807.pdf) studies the rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus in EU countries from 1990 to 2019. They don't spend much time discussing the UK specifically, but they do point out that the relatively high prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the UK in combination with the relatively low mortality rates of Type 2 diabetes may point to earlier diagnoses and better treatment of the disease when compared to EU countries. Obviously, this is only concerning Type 2 diabetes but may still be a useful resource.  

### Screening
This paper by Clift et al. [(15)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-022-01714-9) attempts to estimate the number of deaths caused by the decrease in screening rates during the COVID pandemic. Although the pandemic is no longer the driving force behind the low screening rates, the screening rates are still low. This paper could be referenced to show the kind of effects we would expect from the rates staying low.  
  
A paper by Choi et al. [(16)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/2/298) discusses the rate of cervical uptakes in the UK. It discusses this in the context of both cervical cancer and HPV, but would certainly still be useful if a point were to be made about general screening rates, even if cervical cancer is not one of the 6 we are focussing on.  
  
This paper by Mazidimoradi et al. [(17)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12029-021-00679-x) looks at the changing in behaviour of colorectal screening rates over the course of the pandemic. It doesn't limit it's focus to the UK, but the UK is discussed amongst other countries. They look at the trends in both types of screening and overall screening rates in a variety of countries, and conclude that in many countries, the reduction of screening during the pandemic recovers to pre-pandemic rates. Interestingly, in our data, we don't see any reduction in bowel screening coverage during the pandemic, and that may be something to investigate further. Another source that looks at colorectal screening is this paper by Lo et al. [(18)](https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/64/2/282.full.pdf). In it they discuss patterns in uptake to colorectal screening over 3 invitation rounds - examining how likely a participant is to join in a round of screening given their past participation as well as other factors.

This is a small CRUK pdf detailing the regional bowel screening programs in the UK. [(19)](https://assets.ctfassets.net/u7vsjnoopqo5/4awPFHUkag06QIM3FB2MRe/2fc0e6d712a372b442e87088e057f44b/rr_0101_screening_programmes_at_a_glance_v4_option_b_r7.pdf)

This is a CRUK webpage discussing uptake of bowel cancer in the UK [(20)](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-screening/bowel-cancer-screening/encouraging-participation-in-bowel-screening). It covers topics such as barriers to screening, inequalities in screening, and methods to improve uptake.

This paper by Duffy et al. explores the utilisation of a wider age range for mammographic screening in the UK [(21)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204520303983). They conducted a randomised controlled trial with 160,921 participants and selected a proportion of them to be screened from 40-48. They then discuss the possibility of this method reducing breast cancer mortality in the UK.

### Cancer Trends
These two papers by Malvezzi et al. [(22)](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0923-7534%2823%2900048-0) and Santucci et al. [(23)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923753423051104?ref=cra_js_challenge&fr=RR-1) have very similar structures. They both look at general trends of cancer mortality rates in the UK and the EU, focusing on Lung and Colorectal Cancer respectively. They take a somewhat similar approach to our cancer rates analysis, fitting a joinpoint poisson regression to the raw number of mortalities and then inferring the ASR from there. I believe the source of data to be largely the same as the Globocan data also, using data from the WHO database. Globocan is a creation of WHO and so the data should be largely identical.  

Another paper that is relevant to the work being done on the position paper is an analysis of trends in indicence and mortality in the UK by Shelton et al. [(24)](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/384/bmj-2023-076962.full.pdf). In this paper they use the CRUK based dataset, but as they have access to more granular data, have been able to stratify by age to focus on the 35-69 age group. They mainly analyse APC trends, but look at the overall APC instead of the AAPC that we could use from the JoinPoint software. Also, similar to the paper above, the effects of trends in risk factors are touched on, but perhaps not in the same detail that we would be able to use, given the data we have collected.
